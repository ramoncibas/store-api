# <a name="how-to-use"></a>‚ÑπÔ∏è Getting Started
To clone and run this application, you'll need:
* Git
* Node.js v18 or higher installed on your computer.

## Installation
### Clone the repository

(It is recommended to clone the [front-end](https://github.com/ramoncibas/store) repository as well)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ramoncibas/store-backend
$ cd store
```

### Install NPM packages
Before running the server, make sure to install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command:
```bash
$ npm install
```

### Starting the server
```bash
$ npm run dev     #The server will start on port 5000 by default.
```

### Swagger
This backend includes API documentation using Swagger. After starting the server, you can access the documentation at:
http://localhost:5000/docs/

### Project Structure
The source code is organized into separate modules for better clarity and maintainability. Key modules include:

| Key Modules  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Auth**  | Functions related to authentication  |
| **User**  | User management  |
| **Cart**  | Shopping cart operations  |
| **Customer**  | Customer information |
| **Product**  | Product management  | 

Each module has its own routes defined in their respective files.

### Tests
To run the application tests, it is necessary for the server to be running, as there are various tests that simulate a user's request, going through the entire server flow.
```bash
$ npm run dev     #The server will start on port 5000 by default.
```
Next, execute the following command:
```bash
$ npm run test     #The test suite will be executed.
```
